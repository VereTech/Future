Requirements:

1. This script must be run from a Windows machine.

2. Powershell must be installed on the Windows machine (if it's not already, just Google for 'download powershell')

3. VMWare's PowerCLI application must be installed. It can be downloaded from the following URL (note that you'll need to create a free account for vmware.com):
	http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/vsphere/automationtools/powercli

4. Powershell's Execution Policy must be set to "RemoteSigned". To do this open a DOS command prompt as an Administrator, and run the following command:
	 powershell set-executionpolicy RemoteSigned



Installation:

1. Login to the Admin console of your N-central server, and upload the 'Datastore Size.XML' file into the Custom Services screen
2. Add a device in N-central for each datastore that you want to monitor
3. For each device, enable Professional mode and the 'EDF Enabled' option on the Properties tab
4. Go to the EDF tab of the device, and grab the EDF Activation code
5. Edit the 'Datastore.PS1' file (you can use Notepad, Wordpad, or your favorite text editor)
      a) Find line 21
      b) Remove all of the text in between the {} brackets (they are just examples)
      c) For each datastore that you want to monitor, add an entry inside the {} brackets  that says "Datastore Name"="EDF Activation Code" (Enclose both the name of the datastore and the EDF activation code in double-quotes)
      d) If you have more than one datastore that you want to monitor, put a semi-colon between each set of Datastore Names/EDF Activation Codes   (for example {"DSName1"="EDFCode1";"DSName2"="EDFCode2")
      e) Find line 138. Wherever you see C:\users\creid\Desktop, replace it with the path where you extracted the 'ESX Datastore.zip' file.
            EXAMPLE: If you downloaded and extracted everything to C:\ESX Datastore, then it would look like the following:
                  $CPATH = "C:\ESX Datastore\axis\WEB-INF\lib\*;C:\ESX Datastore\jar\*;C:\ESX Datastore\resources"
      f)Save and close the Datastore.PS1 file

6. Go into the 'resources' folder, and edit the two *.properties files using Notepad or Wordpad. Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP or FQDN of your N-central server.
7. Make sure that everything works smoothly
      a) Run the Datastore.ps1 script by opening a DOS prompt as administrator and typing: powershell ./Datastore.ps1
      b) In N-central, go to the Status tab of one of the Datastore devices - if all worked well, you should see the 'Datastore Size' custom service
