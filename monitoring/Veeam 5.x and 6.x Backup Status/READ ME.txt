Hello N-able Partner!

Just a few quick notes about this custom service, as it's a little bit different than your normal, run-of-the-mill N-central custom service.


1. If you're running Veeam 5.x, the included PowerShell script needs PowerSehll 2.0 to be installed.
2. If you're running Veeam 6.5 or newer, the included PowerShell script needs PowerShell 3.0 to be installed.
3. This custom service requires that the included Powershell script be run on the device on a regular basis. This can be done through N-central as a Scheduled Task, 
   or in Windows as a Windows Scheduled Task - either way is fine.
4. The script only works on Veeam 5.0 and newer, and requires that Powershell is installed on the same machine
5. The script does not require any additional command line parameters
6. Once you have added the service to the device in N-central, you must configure it with the name of the backup that is to be monitored. This is done on the 'Service Details' tab of the service
7. if you have any questions or issues, please e-mail me at creid@n-able.com

Thanks and enjoy!
